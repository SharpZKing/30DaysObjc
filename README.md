# 30DaysObjc

##Hello open source community

I'm Kuan-Wei, a person without any computer sicence background but becoming an iOS engineer after learning how to code in one year.
I only have the entry level of iOS coding skill and still want to learn more and share more. That's why I'm sharing this project to the community.

Althought Swift is hot right now and I actually start to learn Swift in the beginning. However, after I start to work as an iOS engineer, most of the projects are still write in Objective-C and they need to be maintained. So Objective-C is equally important for people like me and I want to write Objective-C code as many as possible.

I have seen a lot of great works and inspired by [allenwong's 30DaysofSwift](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift), so I would like to do a similiar project called 30DaysObjc.
